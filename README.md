# x16basic

This is a small repository where I will add some basic tutorials for coding on the X16 in BASIC


-Falling Snake--------

This is a short game, which can be typed in the X16.
It is short in order to make it fully understandable. 
The game uses the standard scrolling effect that is accessable from Basic.
All graphics are in PETSCII
The controls are Left and Right cursor keys.
